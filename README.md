# nuclai_mcts
This is an annotated version of my talk on MCTS from the 2015 [nucl.ai](http://nucl.ai/) conference, which can be found [here](http://gwaredd.github.io/nuclai_mcts/)

## Building
To build

* Install [node.js](https://nodejs.org/)
* From the command line, go into the build folder
* npm install
* gulp
 
You may need to install gulp globally (npm install --global gulp), may also require other plugins. Building is unsupported but I've included the source just for fun.
